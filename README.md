$ docker-compose up postgresMetadata
```

When the container is running please go to maven and then install
```bash
# or run
$ mvn install
```

then when the target folder is available you can now run
```bash
# docker compose to run all containers which will automatically run the application

Now that the application is running you can open it on localhost:8080
